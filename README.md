# Hi there, I'm Daniel 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a System Administrator with a degree in Cybersecurity, currently working toward developing skills and gaining experience to pursue a role in security in the future.
I am using my github as a place to store and share differnet projects I build in my free time for fun and for learning and devloping my skills and knowledge for my career. 

## 📂 Projects
Here are some of the projects I'm currently working on or have completed:

- **[SlitherySnake](https://github.com/dscott2113/SiltherySnake):** My first experience with pygame. A simple version of the classic snake game.
- **ceaser_cypher** A python script I made when leanring about cryptography in school to better understand how it works.
