# Hi there, I'm Daniel 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a **System Administrator** with a degree in **Cybersecurity** from WGU🦉, currently working to develop my skills and transition into a role in security.
I'm using this space to share projects I build in my free time — for fun, for learning, and to grow my knowledge and experience in IT and cybersecurity.

## 📂 Projects

Here are some of the projects I’ve worked on:

## 🔬 **Home Lab Write Ups**

- 🗺 **[Azure SOC Lab](https://github.com/dscott2113/Azure-SOC-Lab-Write-Up/blob/main/readme.md)** 
  A project I did to learn and gain experience with Azure, KQL, and setting up and using a SIEM.

## 🐍 Python Coding

- 🔐 **[File Integrity Monitoring Script](https://github.com/dscott2113/FileIntegrityMonitor)**  
  A Python script that monitors files and directories for unauthorized changes by calculating and comparing file hashes.

- 🐍 **[SlitherySnake](https://github.com/dscott2113/SiltherySnake)**  
  My first project using Pygame — a simple version of the classic Snake game.

- 🛡️ **[ceaser_cypher](https://github.com/dscott2113/ceaser_cypher)**  
  A Python script I built while learning about cryptography to help understand Caesar ciphers more deeply.
